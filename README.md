# Fake News Detector

## Context

We live nowadays in a world where fake news are all around us. Some of them we might not even know if they are actually fake or not. And we know that fake news have had an influence in the outcome of the 2016 US Elections and Brexit.

Lately there have been new developments in the field of NLP (Natural Language Processing), with new models being able to translate documents in real time, and others with the ability to talk to us through chats.

So, given the current situation that we face and the technology that we have at our disposal, **can we create a machine learning model that can detect wether a news article is fake or not?**

## Tools

For this project, these were the tools and models used:
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * [TFIDF](https://towardsdatascience.com/natural-language-processing-feature-engineering-using-tf-idf-e8b9d00e7e76)
  * [Word Clouds](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/)
  * [LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/09/overview-topics-extraction-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation.html)
  * [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
